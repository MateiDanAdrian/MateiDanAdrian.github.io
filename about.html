            <q><i>Christine Hopkins listened and understood my case. Her communication skills made me feel that my goals were her priority. She never left me without answers to my questions. She was a tenacious advocate for my cause of action. She pushed pretrial settlements and didnâ€™t hesitate bringing my case to trial when the other side refused to respond with anything meaningful. She spoke the language of the law in a way that helped me understand what I needed to know.</i></q><br>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <q><i>I just wish that I learned about you earlier. I thought I would have to pay something I did not owe, up to the last cent. But you know the law and you did an excellent job. Grateful.</i></q>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <q><i>I was very pleased with the knowledgeable and affordable consultation on my employment law issues. I would recommend Suits Corporation without reservation.</i></q>

            <q><i>Great representation! I would recommend her services to others. Thank you Ashley!!</i></q>

            <h3>WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT</h3>
            <p>Since 2005, our attorneys have practiced Employment Law exclusively.  We know the law, and we have the practical experience to back it up.  Our attorneys have argued and tried cases in the state courts of Dallas, Collin, Denton, Ellis, and Hunt Counties; the Federal courts across Texas, Arizona, Michigan and California; in private arbitrations across Texas; in the appellate courts of the 5th, 6th, 8th, and 9th Circuit Federal Courts of Appeals, and in the United States Supreme Court.<br>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            We are <a style="text-decoration:none" href="http://www.certifiedlawyer.com"><font color="#4c997f">Board Certified</font><a> in Labor & Employment law.  Board Certified lawyers are the only attorneys allowed to publicly represent themselves as specialists in a select area of the law. This designation is reserved for attorneys with the highest, public commitment to excellence in their area of law.  According to the TBLS, it means we have "substantial, relevant experience" in employment law, as well as "demonstrated, and tested, special competence" in the area.  There are more than 70,000 attorneys licensed to practice in Texas. Less than 10% are Board Certified.<br>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            We don't use experience as a crutch, and we never stop learning.  That's why we're members of the <a style="text-decoration:none" href="https://texasbarcollege.com"><font color="#4c997f">College of the State Bar of Texas</font></a>.  The College recognizes lawyers who maintain and enhance their professional skills, and the quality of their service to the public, by significant voluntary participation in legal education.  That means we go above-and-beyond the minimum attorney education requirements - always striving to improve and to better assist our clients.
