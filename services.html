              <p>
                We advise many of United States of America’s most successful financial institutions. Our strong reputation in insurance and financial services is due to the strength of the long-term partnerships we have formed with these market–leading organisations. <br>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                We are a finalist in the 2017 United States of America Insurance Industry Awards in the category of Professional Services Firm of the Year. We were again a finalist in the 2016 American Law Awards in the category of Insurance Specialist Firm of the Year, and in 2013 we were selected by clients to be the winner of the International Law Office Award for Insurance and Re-insurance in United States of America. <br>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                We are recognised in the 2017/2018 Edition of the Best Lawyers in USA in the practice area of Insurance Law. This year marks our fifth year of recognition in this publication. <br></p>

              <h3>COMMERCIAL</h3>
              <p>
                Exploiting the potential while mitigating the risks: it’s a perennial balancing act.  It’s also why in this ever increasing complex, interconnected and regulated commercial realm that you need trusted legal partners to help navigate such a shifting and challenging landscape.</p><br>
                At Suits, our talented, specialist lawyers look beyond individual deals to incorporate business, legislative, market and industry drivers to arrive at an opinion or solution that is as commercially savvy as it is legally sound. <br>
                They work closely with our other teams, as needed, to advance your business objectives with timely, strategic and technical advice.
